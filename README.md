# The Legend of Kato
## Scenario
Kato is an ordinary boy. 
<br/>
He slept in his bed as usual. How suddenly a strange sea creature appeared in his room. 
<br/>
Waking it up, it said: "_Hello Kato! I came from the underwater world. I am a magician, the people of my world instructed me to find the one about whom it was written in the prophecy. The fact is that our world is being destroyed. An evil underwater dragon is terrorizing our world. It is destroying and kills all living things._" 
<br/>
He also talked about the fact that there was an underwater army that tried to kill the dragon, but after they went down to his cave, no one saw them.

After his story, the wizard opens a portal right in the window, which leads to the underwater world. **Adventure beggins!**
